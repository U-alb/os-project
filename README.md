## Example Code

Here is a snippet of how the game defines the player

```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.health = 100
        self.attack = 10
        self.defense = 5

    def is_alive(self):
        return self.health > 0

    def print_status(self):
        messagebox.showinfo("Outcome",
                            "\n" + "-" * 20 + "\n" + f"{self.name}: Health = {self.health}, Attacking = {self.attack}, Defense = {self.defense}")

    def modify_attack(self, value):
        self.attack = value

    def modify_defense(self, value):
        self.defense = value
